# Alarm-Fatigue
Researched and developed an intelligent solution to combat alarm fatigue in hospitals, improving patient safety by filtering and prioritising critical alerts.

Designed a human-centred approach that minimises noise, reduces caregiver stress, and ensures timely medical response.

Integrated smart escalation features to improve communication between caregivers and enhance teamwork in high-pressure clinical settings.

Focused on balancing technology with empathy by ensuring only relevant alarms reach the right person at the right time.

Worked on creating a scalable, AI-driven app that bridges the gap between medical devices and healthcare staff, aiming for faster, safer, and more reliable patient care.
